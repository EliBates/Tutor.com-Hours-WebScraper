# Tutor.com Hours Scraper

This was a small python program that I created to automate the process of saving my scheduled work hours at my job to an ICS calendar file.

The problem was that the way the company schedules the hours is in U.S. Eastern time, but I am not living in that time zone so I was having to manually add all of my hours to my calendar each week. 

I spent a few hours learning how Selenium worked and got a little experience with Python along the way.
